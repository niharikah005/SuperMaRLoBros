# About the Project
The aim of reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop algorithms that enable agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environment. By receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on their actions, agents can improve their decision-making over time to maximize cumulative rewards. This approach is widely used in various applications, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems, where the agent learns to make a series of decisions that lead to successful outcomes in complex environments.

- To install the requirements 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Installation
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/niharikah005/SuperMaRLoBros 
```

# Theory and Approach
* For our project, Super MaRLo Bros, we have implemented a reinforcement learning architecture using model-free algorithms to train an AI agent capable of playing the game. This approach allows the agent to learn optimal strategies through trial and error, improving its performance over time without requiring a predefined model of the game environment. The use of these algorithms enables us to effectively handle the dynamic nature of gameplay, where the agent learns from its interactions and adapts its strategies accordingly.
